Thank you for nurturing me for 6 ongoing years NSA TAO. Burgeoning increase in skills in coding, basic cryptosystems, pen and paper algorithm or equation design. Dealing with a brain tumour and SRA really was a make-a-wish-come-true-foundation moment for tutelage via cryptography by the NSA cryptanalysis centre. Remember being at Denver airport before the age of 10. will return to America, though not Disneyworld one day. Applied for a 140k career this morning with my OSCP as listed on job postings for the OSCP, in Brisbane, TAO partly mentored me to complete my 2015 OFFSEC qualification. Looking to formalise skills with an AQF or edX certificate from Uni or college
